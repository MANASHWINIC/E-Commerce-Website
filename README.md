Project Overview:
       This project focuses on developing a feature-rich e-commerce website designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers and an efficient management system 
  for administrators. The platform aims to make online shopping intuitive, engaging, and secure, catering to various product categories and user needs.The frontend is 
  built using React, MUI (Material-UI), Tailwind CSS, and Redux for state management, ensuring a modern, responsive design with smooth navigation. The backend, powered by 
  Node.js and Express.js, handles server-side operations, while MongoDB ensures efficient storage and retrieval of product, user, and order data. The inclusion of payment 
  simulation provides a realistic checkout process for testing and demonstration purposes.

Here is a step-by-step guide to setting up the frontend and backend for your project:

1. Create a Folder for the Frontend Part
First, create a folder where you'll store the frontend code. cd frontend
2. Initialize the React Project
Open the terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, and run the following command to create a new React project: npm init vit
Follow the prompts to set up the React project. This will install the necessary dependencies.
3. Install Required Packages
Once the React project is initialized, change your directory to the frontend folder and install the required packages: bootstrap, axios, and react-router-dom: npm install bootstrap axios react-router-dom
Wait for the installation to complete.
4. Run the React Development Server
Now, start the development server to see the React app in action: npm run dev
This will give you a link, usually http://localhost:3000/, where the app will be running.
5. Access the UI
Open the link provided in your browser, and you should see the UI of your React app.
You can navigate to the register or login pages to interact with the frontend part of the page.
6. Connect to the Backend
To connect the frontend with the backend server, change the directory to your backend folder and start the backend server: npm start
This will start your backend server, and your frontend will now be connected to the backend for API calls.
